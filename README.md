# LEDES-File-Editor
C#.NET Framework Windows Forms Application for loading, editing, previewing, and writing .LED LEDES 98B files for legal billing

This is a new free-for-commercial-use and open-source data processing application I've written. Since I've started at Harpst Becker LLC, I've had to start working with specially delimited file formats for Legal Billing called LEDES 1998B files. This file format (.LED) is a 24-field, pipe-delimited ASCII file. Our legal billing software didn't allow us to take posted bills and generate LEDES files with ease, so I created this windows forms application (Free and Open-Source under GNU_GPLv3.0) in order to upload, edit, add new lines to, preview, and write .LED files with ease. If you work in law or legal billing, feel free to download the application to use for free (the .exe file in the repository), or share it to your lawyer, paralegal, and legal billing friends.

According to LEDES.org (Ledes Oversight Committee):
"LEDES 1998 was the first standard issued by the cross-industry consortium led by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) for ebilling. The format documentation is no longer available. The standard was quickly updated and replaced by LEDES 1998B.

LEDES 1998B is an ASCII, pipe delimited format containing 24 fields. It is currently the most-widely used ebilling standard in the legal industry in the US.

It is not intended that the LEDES 1998B format will be modified in the future."
